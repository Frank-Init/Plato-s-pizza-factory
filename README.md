# Power BI Super Store Dashboard Project

This project involves creating a dashboard in Power BI using the Super Store dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dashboard provides insights and visualizations based on the sales data, including key performance indicators (KPIs) and analysis of various dimensions.

## Overview

The Super Store dataset contains information about sales transactions, including order details, product categories, customer demographics, and geographical information. The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore and analyze the sales data effectively.

## Files

- `super_store_data.csv`: The raw dataset obtained from Kaggle.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Data Transformation Process

1. **Data Import**: Imported the Super Store dataset into Power BI.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query Editor to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format columns.
3. **Table Expansion**: Expanded the dataset into fact and dimension tables to organize the data structure efficiently for analysis.
4. **Data Modeling**: Created relationships between fact and dimension tables to establish a data model for analysis.

## Power BI Dashboard

1. **Data Analysis**: Utilized DAX functions to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales revenue, profit margin, and customer retention rate.
2. **Visualization**: Designed interactive visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, maps, and slicers to provide insights into sales performance, product categories, customer segments, and geographical distribution.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Combined the visuals into a comprehensive dashboard layout with intuitive navigation and filters for user interaction.
